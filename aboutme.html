    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Somewhere along the way I've turned illustrating squiggles on Microsoft Paint as a toddler into designing for a career. Miami born, raised and educated, I recently took my talents to Boston and worked as an Editorial Design Co-Op at the Boston Globe until December 2015. I'm now finishing up my degree in journalism and graphic design at the University of Miami.

      Come June, I'll be working at the Washington Post in their design department.

      You can most likely find me drumming up my next idea; eating croquetas, attempting to knit my 1000th scarf, or doing all three at once.

      Drop me a lineâ€“I'd love to hear from you.</p>
