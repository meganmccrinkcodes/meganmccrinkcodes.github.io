    <h1>This is my web page using different tags (this is the head tag)</h1>

    <strong>Here is the strong tag. The strong tag can be combined with other tags.</strong>

    <p><strong>This is the paragraph tag. I am also using the strong tag here.</p></strong>

    <p>Here is the paragraph tag again</p>

    <ol>-Take a look at this list</ol>

    <ol>-This is using the ol tag</ol>
    </ol>

    <ol>-The ol tag helps make indentations so it looks like a list</ol>

    <p><a href="http://www.meganmccrink.com/">Here is my website. I used the "a" tag for this.</a></p>

    <h1><strong>Answers to questions for this exercise</strong></h1>

    <p1><strong>What does a tag do? What does it mean?</strong></p1>

    <ol>Two tags make up one element. An element tells the browser about information inside the opening and closing tags. For example, some elements are headers, paragraphs, strong emphasis, etc.</ol>

    <p2><strong>Can tags be used in conjunction with others?</strong></p2>

    <ol>Yes, tags can be used in conjunction with others. For instance, if you want to emphasize a particular head or paragraph, you can use the strong element. The strong element will bold it so it stands out on the page.</ol>

    <p3><strong>Does a tag need attributes to work?</strong></p3>

    <ol>Not necessarily. The strong tag can be used alone and still work, BUT it can also be used with the paragraph tag and work too.</ol>

    <strong>deems something as context to it and makes it higher in importance in regards to hierarchy, like searching, etc.</strong>

    <b>the bold tag only bolds things and does not add a strong emphasis</b>

    <dialog open="open">

    <p>here are some examples of different headline sizes</p>

    <h1>headline 1</h1>
    <h2>headline 2</h2>
    <h3>headline 3</h3>
    <h4>headline 4</h4>
    <h5>headline 5</h5>
    <h6>headline 6</h6>

    <button>This is an example of a button tag.</button>

    <hr>

    <ul>
      <li>this is a list item with a bullet point</li>
      <li>here is another item listed</li>
    </ul>

    <p>the "ul" item indicates that the order does not matter. This shows bullet points.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>this is a list item.</li>
      <li>another item</li>
    </ol>

    <p>the "ol" tag does not use bullet points, but instead numbers.</p>

    <nav>
      <ul>

    <p>line breaks, "br" are used in the address tag, but should not really be used anywhere else. It is a self closing tag.</p>
