    <h1>This is my web page using different tags (this is the head tag)</h1>
    <strong>Here is the strong tag. The strong tag can be combined with other tags.</strong>
    <p><strong>This is the paragraph tag. I am also using the strong tag here.</p></strong>
    <p>Here is the paragraph tag again</p>
    <ol>-Take a look at this list</ol>
    <ol>-This is using the ol tag</ol>
    </ol>
    <ol>-The ol tag helps make indentations so it looks like a list</ol>
    <p><a href="http://www.meganmccrink.com/">Here is my website. I used the "a" tag for this.</a></p>

    <h1><strong>Answers to questions for this exercise</strong></h1>
    <p><strong>What does a tag do? What does it mean?</strong></p>
    <ol>Two tags make up one element. An element tells the browser about information inside the opening and closing tags. For example, some elements are headers, paragraphs, strong emphasis, etc.</ol>
    <p><strong>Can tags be used in conjunction with others?</strong></p>
    <ol>Yes, tags can be used in conjunction with others. For instance, if you want to emphasize a particular head or paragraph, you can use the strong element. The strong element will bold it so it stands out on the page.</ol>
    <p><strong>Does a tag need attributes to work?</strong></p>
    <ol>Not necessarily. The strong tag can be used alone and still work, BUT it can also be used with the paragraph tag and work too.</ol>
